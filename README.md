# myModule

This is a python module that contains several useful submodules covering various fields. A submodule will be seperated and assigned an independent repository once it is 'mature' enough.

Currently myModule contains:

 1. utilities of plotting band structures from several softwares: entos, cp2k, CRYSTAL17 and CASTEP.
 2. utilities of generating CASTEP input files.
 3. auto-generation of gaussian 16 input files, along with utilities to perform manipulation on atoms.
 4. plotting density of states from entos.
 5. perform atom manipulation.
 6. read log file from gaussian 16 (supports auto plotting of IR spectroscopy), CASTEP and CRYSTAL17.
 7. auto generation of job system submission scripts (slurm & PBS)
